# DEPRECATED

This image has been deprecated in favor of the [official `elasticsearch` image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) provided and maintained by [elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/). The list of images available from Elastic can be found at [www.docker.elastic.co](https://www.docker.elastic.co/). The images found here will receive no further updates once the `6.0.0` release is available upstream. Please adjust your usage accordingly.

Elastic provides open-source support for Elasticsearch via the [elastic/elasticsearch GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) and the Docker image via the [elastic/elasticsearch-docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker), as well as community support via its [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).

## Maintained by: [the Docker Community](https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch)

This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/) (not to be confused with any official elasticsearch image provided by elasticsearch upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full description from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/) is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/elasticsearch](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/elasticsearch).
